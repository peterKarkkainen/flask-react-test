# Fullstack Boilerplate

Build a React Form where you'd be able to select a name from a list of 3000 names, show the selected value and submit.

## Instructions

1. Use any approach for setting up the Flask from app-flask folder, install the required packages
2. Set up React from app-react folder
3. Build a simple form that would allow a user to select a name from a very long list, visually confirm the selected value and submit the form to the back-end
4. The back-end endpoint for GET is  '/data', for POST is '/result'.
5. As an addition: you can provide any type of type validation for the incoming value on the POST endpoint. 

You can use any front-end and back-end libraries of your choice.
